I’m **Mark**, or **Markus**, also known by my username **headquarter8302**.

I exist, at the very least.

**I’m interested in:**

[Front end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development), simple [Progressive web apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application), and [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), plus some other things.

**I’m ~currently~ perpetually learning:**

- Frameworks
- New web technologies
- Everything else

**Contact me:**

- Here at GitHub by mentioning my name
- At Discord, `headquarter8302`
- Anywhere else where the handle or username headquarter8302 or Headquarter8302 is used, hopefully that's me and not someone else

If you are wondering why there is nothing on my account, that is because this is my personal account. I rarely showcase code outside of work.
