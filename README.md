# <p align="center">Greetings</p>
  
**I’m Mark, or Markus**, also know for my username **@headquarter8302**

I'm currently into FANDOM wikis.

**I’m interested in:** [front end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) and simple [PWA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)

**I’m currently learning:**

- Frameworks
- New web technologies.

**Contact me:**

- Here at GitHub by mentioning my name.
- At Discord.
- [FANDOM Community Central](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Message_Wall:Headquarter8302).

**Currently working as:**

A software analyst and web designer (Weasel words for "Hey, I found a bug here, let's blame it and compromize team integrity!" And "I make websites"). So yeah, not accepting jobs for the moment.

If you are wondering why there is nothing on my account, that is because this is my personal account. I rarely code outside of work.
