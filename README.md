**I’m Mark, or Markus**, also known for my username **@headquarter8302**

I uhh, exist.

**I’m interested in:**

[Front end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) and simple [PWA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application), and some other things.

**I’m ~currently~ perpetually learning:**

- Frameworks
- New web technologies.
- Everything else

**Contact me:**

- Here at GitHub by mentioning my name.
- At Discord, `headquarter8302`
- Anywhere else where the handle or username @headquarter8302 is used, I think.

**Currently working as:**

A junior General Development Supervisor. Yeah, I write less now.

If you are wondering why there is nothing on my account, that is because this is my personal account. I rarely code outside of work.
