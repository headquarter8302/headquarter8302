# Greetings

**I’m Mark, or Markus**, also know for my username **@headquarter8302**

I'm currently into FANDOM wikis and making my own webpages, at least that is what I can do at this point. [Website](https://headquarter8302.github.io)

**I’m interested in:** [front end web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) and simple [PWA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)

**I’m currently learning:**

- JavaScript, specifically Jquery.

```python
is_python = True

if is_python == True:
  print("Also learning python")
```

**Contact me:**

- Here at GitHub by mentioning my name.
- At Discord.
- [FANDOM Community Central](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Message_Wall:Headquarter8302).

**Currently working as:**

A software analyst and web designer (Weasel words for "Hey, I found a bug here, let's blame it and compromize team integrity!" And "I make websites"). So yeah, not accepting jobs for the moment.
